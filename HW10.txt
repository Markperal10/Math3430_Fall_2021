Question 01)
Briefly describe a computing project you would find interesting to work on in
the future.

A computing project that I would find interesting would be to crate an old school video game such as Galaga
or even a simple 2D character game like Mario. Due to these games being older I would hope that they use simple functions for their
games and the process to create one. It would be intersting to see how the game runs, how to change certain things, and what cool things could be added.
Another project I think would have sparked interest in me would be some sort of an application or even tool to help edit music or create sounds and beats off of a 
simple keyboard or function even. Being a big music fan myself I think that would have been something different to test out!
