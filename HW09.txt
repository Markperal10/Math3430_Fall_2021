Question 01) 
Recently we discussed floating point arithmetic, which has become
the standard way of representing numbers on a computer. One of the key aspects
of floating point numbers is that the gap between a number and it's floating
point representation increases with the magnitude of the number. 
This differs from what is called a "fixed
point" representation, where the gap is constant. 

What is an advantage or disadvantage to using floating point instead of fixed
point?

The advantage to using a floating point instead of fixed point is how much more accurate it is to getting
the correct answer due to the values between integers. Due to the fluctuation of the magnitude they have a larger range
of values in which they can be represented rather than the fixed point being of less value because the gap is constant.
A disadvaantage of a floating point is due to the many values it can cause an accurate answer yes but it will never be an exact number due to
its multiple values and can even cause it to be less precise at times.
